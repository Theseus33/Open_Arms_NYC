                <p>Ready, Willing & Able is the most comprehensive transitional work program in the country. Since 1990 the program has 
                transitioned more than 22,000 men back to mainstream society after incarceration and homelessness. At the heart of Ready,
                Willing & Able is paid transitional work—the opportunity to go to work and earn money from a participant’s first day in 
                the program—complemented by transitional housing, education, career development and training, and personalized case 
                management and social services. After 9-12 months, participants graduate from the program with the work and life skills 
                necessary to achieve permanent self-sufficiency and become economic engines for their families and in their communities.</p>

                <h4>First Step helps homeless and low-income <b>women</b> gain the skills, experience and confidence needed to find living-wage jobs.</h4>
                <p >The Coalition’s First Step Job Training Program was launched in 1991 to give homeless and low-income women the training, social support, 
                education and work experience they need to overcome those obstacles, empowering them to build a better life for themselves and their families.

                First Step offers six 14-week classes serving roughly 140 women per year. Our innovative curriculum includes over 100 hours of computer 
                instruction, along with literacy workshops, communication and interpersonal skills development, and other hands-on activities that give students a thorough and practical understanding of the job market and workplace. First Step also places students in internships with major corporations or non-profit organizations, and offers ongoing mentoring by experienced professionals.</p>
                <br />
                <p>If you have questions about First Step or if you would like to sign up for an Informational Session, please call 212-776-2074.</p>

                <p>
                Our 4-6 month vocational rehabilitation program, Project Comeback, provides recovering homeless individuals with the skills, support 
                services and motivation they need to obtain and sustain full-time employment and economic independence. Participants receive job-readiness 
                training, supported work experience (providing maintenance services to New York City streets and parks), Adult Basic Education, supplemental 
                skills training (Occupational Safety & Health Administration [OSHA]; Food Protection) and vocational support services, including life skills 
                development and job search assistance. Program activities take place seven days each week year-round, with each participant attending five 
                days weekly, graduating from the program once he/she finds full-time employment.</p>
